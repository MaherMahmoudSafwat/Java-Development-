     * The `throw` keyword in Java is used to explicitly **throw** an exception from a method or a block of code.
     * It is used when the program detects an error or an exceptional condition and needs to signal that an error has occurred.
     * When an exception is thrown using `throw`, the normal flow of execution is interrupted, and the control is passed to the nearest
     * `catch` block that can handle the exception.
     *
     * Benefits of `throw`:
     *
     * 1. **Explicit Exception Throwing**:
     *    - `throw` allows you to explicitly throw an exception at a specific point in your code when a certain condition is met.
     *      This provides better control over when and where exceptions are raised.
     *
     * 2. **Custom Exception Handling**:
     *    - By using `throw`, you can throw custom exceptions that are specific to your programâ€™s logic, providing better error handling.
     *      You can create and throw user-defined exceptions to signal particular errors that are unique to your application's domain.
     *
     * 3. **Error Reporting**:
     *    - Throwing exceptions can help report specific errors to the caller (higher-level methods). It allows you to separate
     *      the error-handling code from the main logic of your program.
     *      This makes it easier to identify, diagnose, and fix issues, as errors are explicitly thrown with relevant messages or information.
     *
     * 4. **Ensures Exception Handling**:
     *    - When you throw an exception, you force the caller to deal with the exception, either by catching it or propagating it further.
     *      This ensures that exceptional cases are dealt with appropriately, preventing the program from continuing in an
     *      inconsistent or erroneous state.
     *
     * 5. **Control Flow**:
     *    - `throw` provides a way to alter the normal flow of execution. When an exception is thrown, control is transferred to the
     *    nearest `catch` block or propagated further

  Exception propagation allows exceptions to be passed from the method where they occur up the call stack to a method that can handle them.

         * The `throws` keyword in Java is used in method signatures to declare that a method might throw one or more exceptions.
         * It is part of the exception handling mechanism and allows a method to signal that it may encounter certain exceptions
         * during its execution, which the caller of the method will need to handle.
         *
         * Benefits of `throws`:
         *
         * 1. **Method Signature Declaration**:
         *    - When a method is declared with `throws`, it makes the exception handling explicit. The caller of the method knows
         *      that it needs to handle the specified exception(s) or propagate them further up the call stack.
         *    - This is particularly useful when working with **checked exceptions**, which must be either caught or declared.
         *
         * 2. **Promotes Robust Error Handling**:
         *    - By declaring exceptions using `throws`, it forces the caller to deal with exceptions properly. It helps to avoid
         *      situations where exceptions are ignored or not handled correctly, improving the reliability and robustness of the code.
         *
         * 3. **Code Readability**:
         *    - Declaring exceptions with `throws` makes it clear what kinds of exceptions a method might throw, making the code
         *      more readable and maintainable. The developer can easily understand which exceptions might be thrown and can plan
         *      their exception handling strategy.
         *
         * 4. **Exception Propagation**:
         *    - The `throws` keyword allows exceptions to be **propagated** to higher levels of the call stack. This is useful when
         *      the current method cannot or does not want to handle the exception but wants to pass it to a higher method for handling.
         *
         * Example of usage:
         *
         * public void readFile(String filename) throws IOException {
         *     // Code that may throw IOException (e.g., FileNotFoundException)
         *     FileReader file = new FileReader(filename);
         *     BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(file);
         *     // Reading file
         * }
         *
         * In this case, `IOException` is declared with `throws`, so any method calling `readFile()` must handle this exception
         * either with a try-catch block or by declaring it further up the call stack.

         * Difference between Exception and Error in Java:
         *
         * 1. Exception:
         * - An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
         * - Exceptions are typically caused by problems that the program can recover from, such as invalid input, file not found,
         *   or network connection issues.
         * - Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-catch blocks, allowing the program to recover and continue running.
         * - Example: NullPointerException, IOException, ArithmeticException, etc.
         *
         * 2. Error:
         * - An error represents serious problems that are usually outside the control of the program, and they cannot be recovered from.
         * - Errors typically occur due to environmental issues like JVM or system-related problems.
         * - Errors are not intended to be caught or handled by the program. They indicate severe conditions, and the program should
         * usually terminate.
         * - Example: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, etc.
         *
         * In summary:
         * - **Exception**: Can be handled and recovered from.
         * - **Error**: Generally cannot be handled, and they indicate more severe problems.

             *
             * 1. **Guaranteed Execution**: The `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception is thrown
             * or not. This is important for performing cleanup tasks such as closing resources (e.g., files, database connections,
             * or sockets).
             *
             * 2. **Resource Management**: It ensures that critical code, like releasing resources or closing streams,
             * is executed even if an exception occurs. Without a `finally` block, resources might remain open,
             * leading to memory leaks or other issues.
             *
             * 3. **Exception Handling Flow**: If an exception is thrown in the `try` block, and the `catch` block handles it,
             * the `finally` block still runs after the `catch` block finishes execution.
             * This ensures that any necessary cleanup code is executed regardless of the success or failure of the code inside the `try`.
             *
             * 4. **Cannot Be Skipped**: Even if you use a `return` statement in the `try` or `catch` block,
             * `finally` block will always execute before the method actually returns a value.
             *
             * Example:
             * - If you're opening a file in the `try` block, you can close the file in the `finally` block to ensure it gets closed whether an exception occurred or not.
